# Thread 2

### 12744932

Tramp Anon this thread is just in case your thread 404's. I wont be able to sleep at night tonight if we dont hear the rest of your story.

### 12745155

I feel you on the homeless shit anon. I too suffered and the world really hates homeless people. Everyone keeps thinking "JUST GET A JOB BUM!" but it's so damn hard to do so when no one respects a homeless man, thinks you're a druggie, and all services require ID and a home address. More of the story?

dear god that polish girl is a fucking saint. I love whoever that person is 

### 12745916

Talk about a fucking screenplay in the making.

However I think Hollywood has made some movies about a poor handsome man taken in by a woman whom eventually fall in love, because it seems like something that would do well in the box office 

### 12746146

Love starts  
this fall,

starring Cameron Diaz as Ewa Tarnowski  
and Jason Statham as Jacob Finley  
...in...  
The Pole who Loved Me.

New years eve was just as special, at the clock struck 00:00 she kissed me and held it for the full minute with her arms wrapped around my back and neck, as she broke, she said "Happy new years..." I said "Happy new years..." We gazed into each others eyes as the fireworks went off deeper in the city, the skies alight with the most romantic and brilliant setting available, after a while, she said "We start as we mean to go on yes?" I said "Absolutely" and we went to the bedroom again and didnt stop until 5am, it was like this until January 4th, we went back to work, and our love grew and grew over the months, we reached March 21st, her birthday, in which I both presented her with a custom mouthpiece for her Saxophone, and confessed my love, and she said something that has always stayed with me, she said "When we met we were alone, I think fate made us meet, Life has been so good since I met you, you are my everything now, I love you too"

My birthday was great too, she took me to Poland to meet her folks, they heard the real story of how we met, and they completely accepted it, and loved me for making her so happy, her mother and friend even hinted at marriage and that I shouldn't make her wait too long... Poland is a great country whatever anyone says, her town was great, the people were really friendly, everything was cheap compared to the UK, and man, do the Poles know how to lay it down and party... I had an amazing tim there.

> Hey anonymous. We need to work on a project, just like 420 chan's /m/ did with their album. We should compile a book titled "Cool story, bro", and in it, we have the best tales that have even been told on 4chan. Trampanon's story is amazing. (EDITOR's NOTE: lol this is exactly what we are doing)

I don't think [Uncle Anon](http://github.com/bibanon/bibanon/wiki/Uncle Anon/) will fly. 

#### 12746428

I think that it would. 4chan is shangri-la for pedos.

Somebody needs to start in on getting this thread archived, and then making a back up to THIS thread. 

#### 12746647

Back when /b/ was not bad, a really great story was [Blindmute Loli](http://github.com/bibanon/bibanon/wiki/Blindmute Loli/) (guy finds homeless little girl who is blind and mute and adopts her) and another similar story about a guy named [Nurse-Kun](http://github.com/bibanon/bibanon/wiki/Damaged Goods/)? who finds a little girl and adopts her 

#### 12746420

i love when 4chan goes story mode  
they're always fantastically written stories  
what happened to that story guy? with the viking hat? i miss him :( 

#### 12746832 

write a book, seriously  
send your parents a copy with "fuck you" written in it 

### 12746525 (**Tramp anon** !!0JNSPD3l2CJ)

Things went so well, we made so many plans, so so many plans, I bought her a ring and popped her the question August 12th, it was an unconditional yes, we planned to have the wedding in her home town in Poland, I had disowned my family after all, and I had no friends, having it in England where nobody would celebrate it with us was pointless, we saved up 4300 quid, the wedding we planned, along with the present I wanted to give to her family, the honeymoon in the Canary Islands needed just under 6000, but we were working hard to make it happen, and although we were living frugally to make it happen, we loved every second of each others company, the passion never left us for even a second, never had an arguement, she was a strong leader who loved and respected her subordinate, I was a loyal subordinate who loved and respected his leader, we worked well as a team, too well, we lived for each others sake, constantly, relentlessly expressing our love for each other, that christmas we spent it in Poland with her 
family, I got every single one of them a gift to show them appreciation for raising and nurturing the love of my life the way they had, I got her a little glass rose made with her and my name inscribed along the stem, she loved it, she really did.

### 12746774 (**Tramp anon** !!0JNSPD3l2CJ)

... February 7th she collapsed at work out of the blue, she fell into a coma. her family came and stopped with me for a while, we visited her every day, there was always someone by her side, every second someone could be there, someone was, I pleaded with her to wake up every single day, even if it was just a whisper, I would say to her "It's christmas... come on babe wake up, you have presents" and a few times I swore I saw her smile.

I got a call in the middle of the night, she passed away May 2nd, she was flown back to her hometown, and I spent every penny I had on her send off, I wanted her to have the most beautiful ceremony anyone ever had.

I got fired. I applied for dole and income support, and I've never left this place for more than a few hours since.

her sax, her clothes, her things, they're all here...  
I go to bed holding her picture every night.  
If moving on means forgetting her, I hope I never ever fucking do.

Holy fucking shit.
I hope you're not making this shit up. 

#### 12747021

God damn, is this real or what? Pretty amazing story, real or not. Makes me realize my life isn't so bad after all, and I need to get off my ass and start experiencing life. 

#### 12746872

>proposed August 12

#### 12747149

>implying months don't repeat after a year passes

I'm having an aneurism right now because of how fucking retarded you are. 

#### 12747090

> He says's "it's christmas" between February and March. I doubt she was in a coma for a year. 

retard, he was tryng to wake her up, she loved christmas, maybe he thought saying it was christmas would make her wake up.

fuck all of you are dense faggots. 

#### 12747096 

He hasn't said whether or not it was real.

#### 12747125

obviously it was real, the guys probably crying his eyes out right now, be a little sensitive you fucking fuck. 

#### 12747168

> what did she actually die of? was an autopsy performed?

she went in with a grade 5 aneurysm that bled into her brain, she never had any symptoms other than the occasional headache, the doctors said there was a chance she would recover.

she died of an irregular vaspospasm

GUESS IT WAS PAINFUL FOR HIM, EH? 

#### 12747405

insensitive fuck, eat shit. 

#### 12747429

you've never lost anyone, obviously. so let me explain.  
remembering the happy things,  
the fond memories.  
is bearable. it's almost as it if lets you be close again as you relive those moments to tell the tale.  
You remember that part, for brief moments forgetting about the sadness it fills you with now.

retelling the sad parts, or how it was near the end...  
that is what breaks you and tears you apart. its very hard.  
>maybe one day you'll understand

### 12747939 (**Tramp anon** !!0JNSPD3l2CJ)

I cried a lot and fell asleep.  
I'm going to bed again after I shower.  
Sorry, I don't have the means to take a pic, my phone is a nokia 1110, my laptop doesnt have a cam, and I've no reason to down a digicam, never have, never will, those 3quid throw aways you get from max spielman was always more than good enough for our uses, we never had much money, we just bought cheap and made it last. even more now.

#### 12748019

Tramp anon, sleep tight dude.  
You're a fucking awesome person and thanks for posting here  
I lack the words to describe how I really feel, but I wish you the best. 

#### 12748185

You should send the story to a screen writer or something.

It'll be like a sad version of [Densha Otoko](http://github.com/bibanon/bibanon/wiki/Densha Otoko) but with [4chan](http://github.com/bibanon/bibanon/wiki/4chan) instead of [2channel](http://github.com/bibanon/bibanon/wiki/2channel/). 

#### 12748031

Speechless here as well.  
Rest well, trampanon. 

### 12747999

it's official. /g/ has a boxxy, and is inching towards civil war. 

### 12748105 (**Tramp anon** !!0JNSPD3l2CJ)

Why would I give a shit if you people believe me or not? What difference would it make? I only posted mt story because someone asked.

Sorry I can't write like Oscar fucking Wilde  
Sorry I feel pain and couldn't elaborate the end, it crippled me to type that much, if you cant sense that, the story was never intended for you to read.

for clarification, i used to say "wake up, its christmas" while she was in her coma because both of the christmas's we shared were special, I thought if anything could bring her back, it would be those.

Life isn't hollywood, if it was, she'd still be here.  

### Unknown ID (**Tramp anon** !!0JNSPD3l2CJ)

There is no happy ever after, at least not in my case, and as months passed I felt the need to be closer to her. I do live on, theres been plenty of times i've though about face-stamping the concrete, but I see her face, she loved life, she never wasted a second, it would be an insult to throw away what was taken from her. 

I used to see her everywhere, and sleep with her picture at night. Sometimes I would go into her closet and just sit, embracing her smell. One of these times I remembered how she used to always wear my clothes and convinced myself doing the same would bring me closer to her. 

I picked the clothes I remembered the most, her pink panties, a modest skirt, and a matching blouse. As soon as I put them on I noticed their warm embrace and became content, so content I continued to wear them for the rest of the night. I even slept in them.

Maybe one day I'll get back on my feel, but for now, every single day hurts like hell, the world can kiss my ass until I'm ready.

#### 12748149 

I'm sorry man.You're a god in my book. 4chan is full of faggots.

STFU faggots 

#### 12748256

If it's any consolation, you brought a major board to it's knees for 8 hours.

You've got this anon's blessings. 

#### 12748235

Trampanon, before you go, can I ask a question?  
What was your fiancée's name? 

### 12748305 (**Tramp anon** !!0JNSPD3l2CJ)

... Tesia.
