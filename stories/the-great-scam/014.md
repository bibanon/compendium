## Alternate Ending

*NOTE: This was written by another person entirely.*

Trazir, Nightfreeze, Hardhead, Thoggins, and an unnamed Investor are floating in the dead of space. Nightfreeze's ship is on fire. Investor is targeting Hardhead, who is targeting Thoggins, who is targeting Nightfreeze. Trazir floats nearby.

Hardhead: Don't fucking shoot, Thoggins! I fucking mean it!
Thoggins: The fuck not? He's a fucking scammer! You fucking know it, too! He scammed you out of 80-fucking-million isk!
Hardhead: Damn it, he fucking did not! I fucking know him, man! We've been through a lot together, and he's always been there! Give him a fucking chance to explain himself!
Trazir: Fuck guys, calm down! We gotta sort this out reasonably, the fucking space police are on the way.
Thoggins: (to Trazir) Shut the fuck up. (turning back to hardhead) No, no more fucking talking. He's going to die right fucking now.
Hardhead: I don't want to kill you Thoggins, but I fucking will if you don't stop this right now.
blips marked "space police" appear on radar.
Thoggins: Bullshit. You know you'd fucking die too.
Trazir: Fucking calm down!
Hardhead: (to Trazir) Shut the fuck up. (turning back to Thoggins) Fucking try me.

The action happens in a second. Nightfreeze suddenly targets Investor and fires his remaining missiles. Investor fires upon Hardhead. Hardhead shoots Thoggins. Thoggins shoots Nightfreeze. Investor and Thoggins are obliterated. Nightfreeze's ship explodes, leaving him stranded in a disabled lifepod. Hardhead sustains critical damage. All is silent. Police sirens can be heard approaching.

Trazir: Oh, fuck this (Trazir salvages jettisoned cargo, begins to warp away. Missile lock sirens are heard, as well as the space police's strident commands that Trazir halt. From off screen, we hear:) Don't shoot! I give up! Don't shoot!
Hardhead:It's alright, Nightfreeze. It'll be alright.
Nightfreeze:(crying) I...I'm a scammer.
Hardhead: Wha..what?
Nightfreeze:(crying) I am a scammer. I'm a scammer, oh God I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I am a scammer.

Hardhead targets Nightfreeze. They both sit in the dead of space, frozen in time. Suddenly, the Space Police burst into range, Shouting for Hardhead to disarm his weapons. Hardhead lets out a low moaning laugh as his lazers begin to charge. As the camera pans away to the distant cosmos, we hear a single lazer blast being fired. Fade to black.
