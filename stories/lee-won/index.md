The story of an anon known as Leon, Lee Won, and a rock band known as the KOREAN POP ROBOTS 9000. It shows their struggles, their awesome acts, and the conflicts that came about.

It was posted to /r9k/ on [[4chan]] to huge success, but was mostly forgotten due to the lack of a major user-contributable 4chan archival institute after the fall of [[Wikichan]].
